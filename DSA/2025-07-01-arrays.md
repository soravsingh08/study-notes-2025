## ARRAY
It is in simple word a collection of values placed inside []
Array is a linear ds which store multiple value in continuous manner:
[linear means one after ther , like stack queue, link list,]
let Arr = ["Rahul", 1, 200]
## PUSH
let Arr = [];
arr.push(100);
arr.push(10);
arr.push(1);
this 100 will be placed inside arr.
## TO GET VALUE 1
console.log (Arr[1]);

## We can also assign value
let Arr = [];
Arr[0] = 10;
Arr[1] = 100;
Arr[2] = 1000;
## Dynamic Array
Js have dynamic array that means unlike like css or python where we have to first define the length of the array here it is dynamic so when we are writing in a order and skip some numbers it will place empty places in the array

let Arr = [];
Arr[0] = 10;
Arr[1] = 100;
Arr[2] = 1000;

Arr[7] = 10000;

here it will show "emptyx5" array

## New Array
let Arr = new Array(3);
here we gave length to our array but as we know js is dynamic it will not return only 3 valeus.

## Array value in Prompt
let Arr = new Array(5);

for(let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
    arr[i] = Number(prompt("enter a value"))
}
console.log(arr);

## Max Element 
let arr = [10,20,30,40,65,100];
let max = arr[0];
foro(let i= 1; i<arr.length; i++){
    if(max<arr[i]){
        max = arr[i]
    }
}
console.log(max);

## Min Element
